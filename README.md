$project
========

$project is intended as a rapid application development environment for high-throughput gating.

Typically you can explore and gate your data in a notebook environment then run thousands of gates using the same strategy. See sample notebook (to be made) for examples.

Features
--------

- Several pre-built functions to make gating easier, from simple threshholding to 1-2d mixed gaussian modelling and principal components
- Support for crunching through folder hierarchies with sample files and linking folder names to your experiment

Installation
------------

Install $project by running:

    pip3 install aligater
